    "title": "Real-time One-Stop Epidemiology,<br/>Where Data Entry Becomes Analysis",
    "description": "Previously, the inefficiency of collecting data in Excel and then moving it to statistical tools or manually drawing graphs was repeated. During this process, data loss or missing analysis timing were frequent problems. We integrated this fragmented process into a single web platform. The moment an epidemiologist enters data, professional statistical computations automatically execute, generating everything from outbreak type diagnosis to the final report instantly.",
