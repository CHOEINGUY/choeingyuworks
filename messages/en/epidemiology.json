    "title": "From Data Input to Analysis,<br/>All on the Web",
    "description": "Easy Epidemiology is a tool that allows you to collect data and analyze it in real-time using only a web browser, without installing any separate programs. We have reflected the voice of the field to unfold complex statistical processes into an intuitive UI."

  "backToPortfolio": "Back to Portfolio",
  "CoreDescription": {
    "title": "Why was a web-based tool needed?",
    "description": "In traditional epidemiological investigation sites, the inefficient method of collecting data in Excel and then moving it to statistical programs (SPSS, SAS) for analysis was repeated. Also, there was a security risk of having to take files containing sensitive personal information outside.",
    "problems": {
      "brokenWorkflow": "Disconnected Workflow",
      "brokenWorkflowDesc": "Data entry (Excel) and analysis tools (SPSS) were separated, so every time there was a revision, files had to be converted and moved.",
      "securityRisk": "Data Security Risk",
      "securityRiskDesc": "Files had to be downloaded to a personal PC for analysis, which posed a high risk of data leakage.",
      "slowProcess": "Slow Decision Making",
      "slowProcessDesc": "It took a long time to get the final analysis results after data collection, making rapid initial response difficult."

    "description": "Even tens of thousands of epidemiological investigation data entries must be handled seamlessly in a web browser. With our custom Virtual Scroll logic implemented without relying on libraries, you can smoothly navigate vast amounts of data without memory load.",
    "recyclingTitle": "DOM Element Recycling",
    "recyclingDesc": "Only the DOM elements visible on the screen are created, and when scrolling, those elements are recycled to replace the data. This allows rendering tens of thousands of rows without performance degradation.",
